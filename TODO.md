# TODO for Adding Serving Suggestions Section

## Steps:

- [x] Edit index.html: Insert a new section with id="serving-suggestions" immediately after the closing </section> of the products section (id="products"). This section will include a heading "Serving Suggestions" and a Bootstrap carousel displaying the five images: suggestion.jpg, suggestion1.jpg, sugestion2.jpg, Suggestions 3.jpg, and suggestion4.jpg.

- [x] Test the page: Launch a local server and use browser_action to verify the new section and carousel functionality.

- [x] Update TODO.md: Mark steps as completed and confirm the task is done.
